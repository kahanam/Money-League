    <h2><a href="plugin1/index.html">MONEY LEAGUE</a></h2>
<p>
  Welcome to The Money League!
</p>

<p>
  This is the most important league you will play in this season. I'm hoping to make this a long term league with the same owners if everything works out. This will be a keeper league with the possibility of going dynasty in the future.
</p>

<p>
  Buy in is $100; however, the highest scoring player each week will win $20, except during playoffs, totaling $260 for the season.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First-$500</li>
    <li>Second-$200</li>
    <li>Third-$40</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Scoring for this league is 0.5ppr with standard ESPN scoring and roster settings. Free agency is auction based with $200 starting and a 1 day waiver period. Trades are highly encouraged and will never be vetoed except when collusion is obvious. If collusion occurs and can be proven then the players colluding forfeit the chance to win money and will be kicked out of the league. In the event of collusion the pot will be given to the next placed players. Collusion includes any agreement, outside of the trade in question, that affects the trade in question: "Trade back" agreements, rentals, money changing hands, buying the other owner a beer, doing work for the other owner, etc. Draft day is Monday, August 27th at 630pm and will be auction style with a $200 budget.
</p>

<p>
  Keeper Rules:
  </br>
  1. 1 keeper per team per year. You can keep a player for 2 years max, not including the year drafted (3 years total).
  </br>
  2. Keeper cost is the same as the draft cost last year + 2.5% of the total budget.
  </br>
  3. A player must be kept for a minimum of 10% of your total budget. This would apply to all undrafted waiver wire pickups.
</p>

<p>
  Good luck!
</p>
