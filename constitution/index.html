      This is a living, breathing constitution that will change and evolve over the lifetime of this league.

            In the event of collusion the pot will be given to the next placed players. Collusion includes any agreement, outside of the trade in question, that affects the trade in question:
            "Trade back" agreements, rentals, money changing hands, buying the other owner a beer, doing work for the other owner, etc.
