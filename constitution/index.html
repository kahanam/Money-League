      This is a living, breathing constitution that will change and evolve over the lifetime of this league.
      Changes will happen between seasons as often as possible and will be effective from that point moving forward.
      If you have suggestions for changes, please submit them to the league commisioner and it may be put to a vote for next season.
      This constitution will not cover every situation as there are too many variables to cover.
    </p>
    <h2>[1.0 League Entry Fee]</h2>
      <h3>[1.1 League Engry Fee - $150 per team]</h3>
        <p class="h3text">

          depending on the circumstances, and will forfeit any weekly winnings back to the total prize pool.
        </p>
      <h3>[1.2 Trophy Maintenance Fee - $40 out of the pot]</h3>
        <p class="h3text">
          Due to greater than expected costs for trophy maintenance and shipping there will be an annual $40 trophy fee starting in 2020. Fee is taken out of the pot
          and will be used by the commisioner to pay for costs related to the trophy that year. Any leftover money from the $40 after the trophy has been engraved and shipped
          will be given back to first place.
        </p>

          scoring team is already in the playoffs then the top 6 seeded teams will make the playoffs. The top 2 seeds get first round byes.
          In the event of a playoff matchup tie, the higher seed will advance to the next round.

            "Trade back" agreements, rentals, money changing hands, buying the other owner a beer, doing work for the other owner, etc.
